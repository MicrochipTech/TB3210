ATTINY817_DAC_Examples
===

This repository contains examples of bare metal source code for DAC as described in TB3210 document from Microchip.
The repository contains an Atmel Studio Solution with multiple projects inside. Make sure you have the necessary tools:
1. ATtiny817 device (or evaluation board ATtiny817 Xplained Mini)
2. Atmel Studio
3. ATtiny817 Device Packs

The following examples are inside this repository:
1. Generating Constant Analog Signal
2. Generating Sine Wave Signal
3. Reading DAC Internally with ADC
4. Using DAC as Negative Input for AC
